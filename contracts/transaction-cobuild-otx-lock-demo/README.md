This demo open transaction lock is based on [SECP256K1/blake160](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list.md#secp256k1blake160) with transaction cobuild and message support.
The [ckb-auth](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth) (commit: cdc2c52) is used to simplify authentication.
